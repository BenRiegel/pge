This reliance manifests itself into a drive for profit at all costs within these corporations. Thus this treadmill of production, the capitalist economic model that creates ecological and social due to the inherent drive to make a profit, becomes apparent. Such a relationship can be observed in the interactions between local organizations and populations and these corporations within petropolises. These petropolises become the unity between satellite towns and the regional economy that are composed of oil refineries and petrochemical plants such as Port Arthur, Texas.",

    "introText": "Australia has the largest supply of proven uranium reserves globally and in 2015 was the third largest producer of uranium. The Four Mile mine is the most recent Australian uranium mine to begin operation and uses in situ leaching (ISL)  to recover mineral uranium. The Adnyamathanha people, the local indigenous tribe, were not fairly represented or considered when the Four Mile was being discussed and they experience a resource curse in which they are subject to a disproportionate quantity of hazards and are excluded from the benefits of uranium extraction.",

    "introText": "The Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill of 2010, also commonly called the BP Oil Spill, is the largest accidental oil spill in history, with over 4.9 million barrels of oil leaked into the Gulf of Mexico over a span of 87 days. The disaster took place on April 20th, about 41 miles off the coast of Louisiana, and resulted in 17 injuries, 11 deaths, and numerous environmental, economic, and social impacts on the region. This paper analyzes these impacts on the region, particularly those placed upon marginalized groups such as Southeast Asian and African American fishermen, and concludes that simple environmentally just practices such as communicating in proper languages were not performed to assist these groups in the aftermath of the spill.",

Though the station benefits the local economy and provides water and electricity to surrounding areas, the local residents not only lack the access to electricity but also have to bear the environmental degradation due to the air pollution from the NGS.",

The Sardar Sarovar Dam is a critical resource that provides water for irrigation as well as hydropower for the industrial sector in Western India. Since the 1980s, various political arguments have arisen regarding which sections of society have to pay the costs and enjoy the benefits of the dam construction. The construction of the dam was put off for several years due to this dilemma, and was finally approved in 1987.",
