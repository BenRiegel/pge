    <introText>Recently, natural gas has been hailed as the new, “clean” fossil fuel and hydraulic fracturing (fracking) as the 21st century technology making it possible. This project considers Dimock, Pennsylvania, where 130 violations were filed against Cabot Oil and Gas, which leased land from locals to extract shale gas.</introText>

    <introText>Energy Answers International, a private energy company based in Albany, New York, is currently building the nation’s largest waste-to-energy incinerator in Curtis Bay, Maryland. These types of power plants emit numerous different pollutants, including conventional greenhouse gases, particulate matter and heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, and mercury. Not only does Curtis Bay already have some of the highest levels of pollution in the nation, but the site for the incinerator is less than one mile away from the Benjamin Franklin High School and the Curtis Bay Elementary School.</introText>

    <introText>In Kusum Tola, India the local indigenous population known as the Adivasi may be forced to migrate from the region as a result of the expansion of open pit coal mining in the region.  Other villages have already been forced to leave due to the growing mine fields of the Central Coalfields Limited (CCL) energy corporation.  Greater energy demands in India have led the CCL to exploit the Adivasi, violating their human rights.  This page explains how the Adivasi’s forced evacuation from Kusum Tola and related environmental injustices are a result of India’s increased reliance on coal due to globalization and industrialization.</introText>

    <introText>Taking the words of Michael Ross, “petroleum wealth shapes the development of nations.” This reliance on oil refineries and large energy companies to provide not just energy but also in developing the nation’s economy bestows them with a level of influence that is able to effect the dynamic of state politics. This reliance manifests itself into a drive for profit at all costs within these corporations. Thus this treadmill of production, the capitalist economic model that creates ecological and social due to the inherent drive to make a profit, becomes apparent. Such a relationship can be observed in the interactions between local organizations and populations and these corporations within petropolises. These petropolises become the unity between satellite towns and the regional economy that are composed of oil refineries and petrochemical plants such as Port Arthur, Texas.</introText>

    <introText>The Alberta oil sands span approximately 142,200 square kilometers in the Canadian province of Alberta, “an area comparable to the state of Florida.” Oil sands are unconventional reserves as they are solid at room temperature and require heating in order to flow. Canada’s oil sands are considered a “significant contributor to the recent growth and expected future growth in the world’s liquid fuel supply.” Local indigenous communities have been negatively affected, however, by the ongoing extraction of oil sands resources.</introText>

    <introText>West Virginia is the country’s second largest producer of coal. The relationship between energy and energy production is one that individuals seldom think about. The process and production is rarely understood by those who don’t go out looking for the information. So often the situation becomes one in which, unless the energy production is “in my backyard,” we tend to not worry about the externalities associated with the production of energy. This is especially true for the production of electricity via coal.</introText>

    <introText>Glen Canyon Dam, on the Colorado River, is a critical resource to provide both power and water to millions in the American West. However, the large-scale disruption of the Colorado River has had unforeseeable environmental and social consequences. Issues of inequity have arisen due to the disproportionate amount of water reaching the region in northern Mexico that relies on the river. Of the water that does reach Mexico, the quality is extremely poor, soiled by the high salinity levels. Issues of sustainability surface, especially because the river already fails to reach the Colorado River Delta.</introText>

Sugarcane plantations occupy 80% of the land area of the county and it has some of the largest and most productive sugarcane mills producing ethanol and sugar (Fig. 1). Piracicaba has the geography of a city center surrounded by agricultural lands and the two distinct spaces closely interact with each other economically, socially and ecologically.</introText>

    <introText>Located within Australia’s Northern Territory, Ranger Uranium mine is the second largest uranium producing mine in Australia and third largest in the world. Operated by Energy Resources of Australia (ERA), uranium drawn from it is exported all over the world to run nuclear power facilities. Though this uranium provides a relatively clean source of electricity for these countries, environmental injustices in the Ranger Mine site have arisen due to the extreme pursuit of profits by mining companies and their disregard for environmental and indigenous well being.</introText>

    <introText>Australia has the largest supply of proven uranium reserves globally and in 2015 was the third largest producer of uranium. The Four Mile mine is the most recent Australian uranium mine to begin operation and uses in situ leaching (ISL)  to recover mineral uranium. The Adnyamathanha people, the local indigenous tribe, were not fairly represented or considered when the Four Mile was being discussed and they experience a resource curse in which they are subject to a disproportionate quantity of hazards and are excluded from the benefits of uranium extraction.</introText>

    <introText>The Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill of 2010, also commonly called the BP Oil Spill, is the largest accidental oil spill in history, with over 4.9 million barrels of oil leaked into the Gulf of Mexico over a span of 87 days. The disaster took place on April 20th, about 41 miles off the coast of Louisiana, and resulted in 17 injuries, 11 deaths, and numerous environmental, economic, and social impacts on the region. This paper analyzes these impacts on the region, particularly those placed upon marginalized groups such as Southeast Asian and African American fishermen, and concludes that simple environmentally just practices such as communicating in proper languages were not performed to assist these groups in the aftermath of the spill.</introText>

    <introText>Located within the Navajo American reservations, the Navajo Generating Station (NGS) is the largest power plant in the western USA. As a key facility of Central Arizona Project (CAP), it generates power from coal to move the water from the Colorado River to other parts of the region. Though the station benefits the local economy and provides water and electricity to surrounding areas, the local residents not only lack the access to electricity but also have to bear the environmental degradation due to the air pollution from the NGS.</introText>

    <introText>The construction of the Sardar Sarovar Dam was approved on the Narmada in 1987, with 10 dams being constructed on the main river along with 20 more on its tributaries. The Sardar Sarovar Dam is a critical resource that provides water for irrigation as well as hydropower for the industrial sector in Western India. Since the 1980s, various political arguments have arisen regarding which sections of society have to pay the costs and enjoy the benefits of the dam construction. The construction of the dam was put off for several years due to this dilemma, and was finally approved in 1987.</introText>

    <introText>South Durban, 25 miles south of the largest port in Africa, is home to the SAPREF and Engen oil refineries.  Negligence in refinery practices along with the nation’s oppressive apartheid past make South Durban a site of severe energy injustice brought about by practices of uneven development.</introText>
